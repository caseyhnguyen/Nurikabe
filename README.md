# Nurikabe
Interactive Nurikabe game that allows users to solve logic puzzles of varying difficulty and use a dynamic solver for help. Created using logic programming implemented in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

Nurikabe game is a logic puzzle in which the player must fill in a grid with black and white cells such that the resulting pattern satisfies certain constraints. The goal is to create a pattern in which all of the white cells form a single connected region and all of the black cells form a series of islands of various sizes. The player must use logic to deduce the correct placement of black and white cells based on the given clues, which typically take the form of numbered squares that indicate the number of contiguous white cells in that row or column. 

The program was created with logic programming using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Puzzle challenges with varying levels of difficulty and a dynamic solver to help users solve the puzzles are included.
